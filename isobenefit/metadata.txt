about=The Isobenefit Urbanism QGIS plugin is a tool for brainstorming walkable urban development against real-world datasets. The algorithm is based on walkable access to centralities (shops, services) and green spaces. Please see the homepage link for more information.
    Please refer to the repository for the source code and the README.md file for additional information.
    Installation requires the installation of the numba and rasterio Python packages. QGIS does not yet have an automated dependency resolution work flow so these packages have to be installed directly; please see the repository README file for examples of how to do this on your system.
    A demo project is provided in the project repository.
